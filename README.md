# Data Science in the NBA
This is a Data Science Introduction course project, in which we had to take any database available online and analyze its data. The database we chose has data from the NBA players and teams since 1991.\
The database is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/19912021-nba-stats) \
The notebook with the analysis is available at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1silZpHQXRbDFYdkoIGlqVFAQexudW9jt) \
